# SEO Practice

> Re-calibrating to new realities before I update Pipulate

SEO is always changing, and this is where I re-calibrate to the new realities.
AI is upon us, of course. But also things need to control web browsers. The
brower is the ultimate unified API. APIs are fine, and we will keep using them.
But the informal stuff is just as important. If you can do it in a web browser,
you can do it automatically. These are things AI agents will control. This is
where I practice what AI agents will control.

## JupyterLab Notebooks

There are many ways to run Python including Notebooks. And there are many ways
to run Notebooks, including the massively popular Google Colab and Microsoft
VSCode editor. These are vendor traps and don't suit my purposes. I need to
control web browsers as if it was me: my logins, my Chrome, from my desktop. And
I don't want heavyweight vendor dependencies. Everything I do should be easily
lifted into a low-dependency lightweight AI agent cluster.
